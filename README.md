(Since I also designed an html page, which doesn't run well on mimic, I uploaded the code to github so that you can run it with Visual Studio)

Assignment Description: 
Embarking on this creative coding adventure, I've brought to life a captivating grid animation using the magic of p5.js. Imagine a canvas divided into a 3x3 grid, where each square dances and evolves in a mesmerizing display.

To make this magic happen, I dived into creative coding concepts like Perlin noise-based animations and dynamic transformations. The colors, a lively mix of contrasts, give the whole scene a vibrant, digital kaleidoscope feel.

The choreography of this grid dance unfolds through some fancy moves - or as we call them, conditional statements. They guide each element based on where it sits in the grid, creating a symphony of pulsating triangles and rhythmic rectangles.

This project was more than just coding; it was a journey into the storytelling potential of code. To take it further, I'm thinking of refining the animations, maybe adding interactive elements, or exploring new grid-inspired patterns. The possibilities are endless when code and creativity come together.
