(Since I also designed an html page, which doesn't run well on mimic, I uploaded the code to github so that you can run it with Visual Studio)

ASSIGNMENT ONE 
MIMIC Link: https://mimicproject.com/code/b734367b-dd16-daa6-c6e6-bfa2de97bac2
Assignment Description: 
Delving into the realm of gaming, I've brought to life a Pac-Man-inspired experience using p5.js. The game unfolds within a defined play area, featuring Pac-Man as the protagonist and a hungry monster as the adversary.
In the code, I've used global variables to manage the game state, integrating conditionals to dictate various outcomes. Use play button kicks off the game. Players will control Pac-Man using keyboard arrows, navigating through a maze and collecting circles to rack up points.
Throughout the project, I explored key creative coding concepts, including conditional statements, user interactions through keyboard controls, and dynamic positioning of game elements. The addition of images, sounds, and visual feedback enhances the overall gaming experience. Global variables proved handy in efficiently handling game states, ensuring a smooth transition between start, play, and game-over phases.
Looking ahead, potential extensions to the project could involve introducing more levels, diverse mazes, or additional challenges. Additionally, enhanced graphics, user interface elements could further elevate the gaming experience. In essence, this Pac-Man game serves as a starting point for me to delving into creative coding principles within the fascinating realm of game development.

Assignment Description: 
In my dive into creative coding, drawing inspiration from the wonders of nature, I've created a mesmerizing visual experience on the canvas. Picture two entities gracefully dancing, their movements guided by the enchanting randomness found in the dance of nature.
At the heart of this creation is the dynamic interplay of positions defined by polar coordinates. A hundred instances of these interconnected points weave an intricate tapestry, resembling the ebb and flow of celestial bodies or the gentle undulations found in nature's rhythms. The varying lengths and speeds of these entities introduce an element of unpredictability, echoing the spontaneous beauty that characterizes the natural world.
As these entities move and intertwine, strokes of changing colors paint a canvas mirroring the organic beauty and harmonious chaos of our surroundings. The hues shift with the sinuous dance, capturing the evolving palette found in nature.
This project has been a journey into creative coding concepts like trigonometry and color mapping, unveiling the expressive potential of code in portraying the essence of the natural world. To delve deeper, I might play with additional parameters, introduce interactive elements, or experiment with visual motifs inspired by nature, pushing the boundaries of this digital representation of interconnected rhythms in the natural realm.

Assignment Description: 
Embarking on this creative coding adventure, I've brought to life a captivating grid animation using the magic of p5.js. Imagine a canvas divided into a 3x3 grid, where each square dances and evolves in a mesmerizing display.

To make this magic happen, I dived into creative coding concepts like Perlin noise-based animations and dynamic transformations. The colors, a lively mix of contrasts, give the whole scene a vibrant, digital kaleidoscope feel.

The choreography of this grid dance unfolds through some fancy moves - or as we call them, conditional statements. They guide each element based on where it sits in the grid, creating a symphony of pulsating triangles and rhythmic rectangles.

This project was more than just coding; it was a journey into the storytelling potential of code. To take it further, I'm thinking of refining the animations, maybe adding interactive elements, or exploring new grid-inspired patterns. The possibilities are endless when code and creativity come together.
