      <p style=padding:20px>
        <b>Delving into the realm of gaming, I've brought to life a Pac-Man-inspired experience using p5.js. The game unfolds within a defined play area, featuring Pac-Man as the protagonist and a hungry monster as the adversary.</b>
        </p>

        <p style=padding:20px>
          <b>In the code, I've used global variables to manage the game state, integrating conditionals to dictate various outcomes. Use play button kicks off the game. Players will control Pac-Man using keyboard arrows, navigating through a maze and collecting circles to rack up points.</b>
        </p>
  
        <p style=padding:20px>
          <b>Throughout the project, I explored key creative coding concepts, including conditional statements, user interactions through keyboard controls, and dynamic positioning of game elements. The addition of images, sounds, and visual feedback enhances the overall gaming experience. Global variables proved handy in efficiently handling game states, ensuring a smooth transition between start, play, and game-over phases.</b>
        </p>
  
        <p style=padding:20px>
          <b>Looking ahead, potential extensions to the project could involve introducing more levels, diverse mazes, or additional challenges. Additionally,  enhanced graphics, user interface elements could further elevate the gaming experience. In essence, this Pac-Man game serves as a starting point for me to delving into creative coding principles within the fascinating realm of game development.</b>
